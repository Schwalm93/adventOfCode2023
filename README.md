Project Name | Description | 
| ---------- | ----------- |
|  [Day01](src/day1)| Sum the calibration values from each line of an elf-altered document by combining its first and last digits. |
|  [Day02](src/day2)| Determine which games are possible with only 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes by checking if any round exceeds these limits, and sum their IDs to get the result. |
|  [Day03](src/day3)| Sum all numbers in the engine schematic that are adjacent to symbols (excluding periods) to find the missing part number. | 
|  [Day04](src/day4)| Sum the points from scratchcards by counting matches with winning numbers, where points double for each match after the first. | 
|  [Day05](src/day5)| In the puzzle, you convert seed numbers to location numbers using an almanac's maps and find the lowest location number for the given seeds. | 
|  [Day06](src/day6)| Determine the number of ways to beat the record in each toy boat race by calculating the optimal button hold time, then multiply these numbers together to find the solution. | 
|  [Day07](src/day7)| You need to rank a set of poker-like hands based on their strength and calculate the total winnings by multiplying each hand's bid by its rank. |
